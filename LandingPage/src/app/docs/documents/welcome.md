# Welcome to FlowDown

FlowDown is a privacy-first AI workspace that blends local inference with OpenAI-compatible services to deliver a smooth, high-quality experience.

## Installation Guide

We recommend installing the production build from the [App Store](./app_store) for the best experience. Advanced users can also build from source on GitHub.

## About FlowDown

FlowDown aims to balance a lightweight interface with powerful model capabilities. Whether you need everyday Q&A or want to explore advanced features of new models, you can switch freely among on-device MLX, Pollinations, Apple Intelligence, and self-hosted endpoints.

We take privacy seriously. Your data stays on your device by default, with optional iCloud sync when you choose.

### Quickstart

The app includes complimentary cloud models from [pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai/) so you can get started immediately. FlowDown automatically fetches the model list and labels free endpoints for tool, vision, and audio support.

> **Note**: Free endpoints may have limited capabilities and slower refresh cycles. For a more stable, efficient experience, configure your own endpoints or local models in **Settings → Models**.

### Feedback & Privacy

Always sanitize feedback before sending. Do not upload service credentials or personal data—blur sensitive fields in screenshots. See the [Privacy Policy](./legal/privacy.md) for details.

## Key Features

- **Immersive experience**: Polished interface with smooth Markdown rendering.
- **Multi-device sync**: CloudKit keeps conversations, model profiles, memories, and MCP services aligned across iPhone, iPad, and Mac, with manual refresh and scoped control.
- **Hybrid model ecosystem**: Native support for Apple Intelligence, on-device MLX models, Pollinations (with auto capability tags), and any OpenAI-compatible API with custom headers.
- **Flexible configuration & sharing**: Set temperature, context length, request body, and auxiliary behavior per model; import/export `.fdmodel` files or drag configurations to share.
- **Memory & automation**: Proactive memory injection and Shortcuts triggers. Titles and icons are generated automatically to reduce repetitive steps.
- **Powerful toolchain**: Calendar management, web search/scraping, location services, URL preview, and MCP toolchains keep complex workflows automated.
- **Shortcuts integration**: Ask, summarize, or create conversation links via Shortcuts (image input on iOS 18/macOS 15), plus exports for conversations, memories, databases, and logs.

## Version Comparison

FlowDown offers two tracks: the continually updated **FlowDown** App Store release and the archived **FlowDown Community** edition. Move to the App Store build for CloudKit sync, modern UI design, and ongoing security updates.

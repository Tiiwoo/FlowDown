# Privacy Policy

## Overview

FlowDown respects and protects your privacy. This policy explains our principles and measures.

**Data privacy commitment**: the App Store label is “Data Not Collected” — we do not collect personal data (identifiers, location, or usage). If policies change, we will update and notify you in advance.

## Core Privacy Principles

- **No data collection**: we do not upload personal data or usage metrics.
- **Local storage**: conversations, model configurations, and memories stay on-device. iCloud sync is your choice.
- **Log export**: logs stay on your device unless you export and share them. Remove sensitive info before sharing.
- **Crash reports**: if you opt into system-level crash sharing, Apple forwards reports; we do not add extra uploads.

### CloudKit Sync

- iCloud storage is provided by Apple; data is stored in your personal iCloud container with Apple encryption.
- You can disable **Settings → Data Control → iCloud Sync** anytime. Turning it off stops new uploads; run **Delete iCloud Data** to clear existing cloud data.
- Operations such as “reset sync state” run locally only; we do not operate developer servers for sync.

## Support & Diagnostics

When requesting support or testing, you might share logs or screenshots. They are used only for troubleshooting and deleted afterward. We never ask for private keys or identity information.

## Third-Party Services

### Cloud model services

- When you use a cloud model, data goes to the provider you select.
- Built-in endpoints are for quick trials only and are not guaranteed. Requests are sent directly to the provider; FlowDown does not add extra recording. For stability, configure your own endpoint.
- Provider policies:
  - **OpenRouter**: [https://openrouter.ai/privacy](https://openrouter.ai/privacy)
  - **Pollinations.ai**: [https://pollinations.ai/](https://pollinations.ai/)

### User-defined settings & risk management

Using enterprise or custom configs may involve transmission risks. We are not responsible for leaks or outages caused by custom setups.

### Tool calls & automations

- Built-in tools (calendar, search, location, memory, etc.) run only after the model requests them and you confirm.
- MCP integrations connect directly between device and server; we do not proxy or log.
- Apple Shortcuts intents run locally and follow the same privacy standard as the app.

## Continuous Improvement

We update this policy periodically and will announce changes in the app or on the website.

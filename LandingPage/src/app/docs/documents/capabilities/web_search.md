# Web Search

FlowDown offers two web search modes: pre-processing for models without tool-calling, and tool-calls where the assistant invokes `web_search` directly. When your model understands tools, turn on both **Web Browsing** and **Tools** so it can plan and cite on its own.

## Enable Web Search

- Go to **Settings → Tools → Web Search** or toggle **Web Browsing** above the composer.
- For tool-capable models: turn on both **Web Browsing** and **Tools**. FlowDown skips pre-planning and lets the model call `web_search`.
- For models without tool-calling: leave **Tools** off and enable **Web Browsing**. FlowDown asks the auxiliary model to decide and draft queries.

## Configuration Guide

- **Search Strategy (Essential / Balanced / Proactive)**: Essential searches only when needed; Balanced balances frequency and speed; Proactive searches aggressively for more coverage. Higher sensitivity can add latency, and lower sensitivity may miss fresh info.

- **Search Limit (5/10/15/20/Unlimited pages)**: shared across all queries in one message. Pages beyond the context budget are dropped to prevent overflow.

- **Web Search Engines** lets you toggle Google / DuckDuckGo / Yahoo / Bing. Keep at least one on; if all are off, FlowDown automatically re-enables all engines.

## Execution Flow

### Pre-processing mode (Tools off)

1. **Context collection** – Last five user/assistant turns plus attachment text.
1. **Query planning** – Auxiliary model applies the Search Strategy prompt and returns XML with `search_required` and up to three queries (2–25 characters, in the user’s language). If `search_required` is false, FlowDown posts a “no web search needed” note.
1. **Failure handling** – If no queries are produced, FlowDown replies that it cannot generate search keywords and skips browsing.
1. **Retrieval** – ScrubberKit + URLsReranker fetch per query (keeps four results per host) and honor the per-message limit, streaming sources/sites/result counts.
1. **Attachment injection** – Results are shuffled, converted to numbered `web_document` attachments, and appended before the model answers. Empty results raise “No web search results.”

### Tool-call mode (Tools on)

- When the model calls `web_search`, FlowDown runs the same ScrubberKit pipeline and streams progress in the status panel. The tool response includes `web_document` text; if nothing is found, it returns “Web search returned no results.”

## Use Cases

- Track fast-moving news or release notes.
- Look up pricing, availability, or policies that change frequently.
- Enrich domain knowledge with recent publications or documentation.
- Capture structured data (tables, lists) from public pages.

## Best Practices

### Ask Effectively

- Provide context, e.g., “Find recent reviews for the latest FlowDown release.”
- Add time ranges or preferred sources, e.g., “Look for docs updated after October 2025.”
- Combine with attachments or notes and ask the assistant to cite `web_document` IDs with `[^n]`.

### Search Tuning

- Use **Balanced** or **Proactive** for dynamic topics; choose **Essential** for speed.
- Keep at least one engine enabled; more engines improve recall but add latency.
- Raise **Search Limit** for sparse or long pages; lower it to conserve bandwidth.
- Review URLs and snippets in the reasoning panel before trusting an answer.

## Privacy Notes

- FlowDown only sends the minimal query terms to providers and does not append personal identifiers.
- Scrubbed content stays in your local conversation history and syncs via iCloud only if enabled.
- Disable web search entirely if your compliance requirements forbid contacting external providers.

## Implementation Details

- Query generation uses the auxiliary model with the Search Strategy prompt (`Model.Inference.SearchSensitivity`).
- Retrieval uses [ScrubberKit](https://github.com/Lakr233/ScrubberKit) plus `URLsReranker` and respects engine toggles and search-limit settings (`ScrubberConfiguration`).
- Tool-call entry point: `MTWebSearchTool` runs the pipeline, and the conversation layer wraps results with `formatAsWebArchive` so the model can cite `web_document` IDs.

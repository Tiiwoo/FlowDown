# Tools & Automation

Tool-capable models can use built-in tools and MCP extensions to enrich context or take actions. Enable “Skip Tool Confirmation” only when you fully trust the model and endpoint.

## Built-in tools

| Group | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Calendar | Read availability, suggest times, create/update events. |
| Web search/scraper | Search or fetch pages and return structured content — see [Web Search](./web_search.md). |
| Location | Current city/coordinates or reverse geocoding (iOS/iPadOS). |
| URL metadata | Expand titles, descriptions, and favicons. |
| Memory | Store, recall, update, or delete long-term memories. |
| MCP | Connect external MCP servers to extend tools — see [MCP Integration](./mcp_integration.md). |

## How to enable

- In conversation: the **Tools** toggle appears when the model supports tool calls; long-press to batch-toggle built-ins and MCP. **Web Browsing** controls whether the current chat may go online.
- Global: under **Settings → Tools**, manage built-ins, MCP servers, and search engines; turn on **Skip Tool Confirmation** only if you need full automation.

## Run flow

1. The model emits a function name with JSON args (including dynamic MCP tools).
2. You confirm, then it runs; with automation on, it runs immediately.
3. Results are written into the conversation and shown live in the reasoning panel; chaining is supported.

## Multimodal & attachments

- Supports text/Markdown, PDF, common images, audio (auto-transcoded to WAV); import via paperclip, drag-and-drop, or paste.
- Media returns only when the model declares matching capabilities; very large attachments can slow sync.

For scenarios: calendar flow in [Calendar Workflow](../guides/calendar_workflow.md), attachments in [Attachments](./attachments.md), memory in [Memory Management](../settings/memory_management.md), and shortcuts in [Apple Shortcuts](../guides/apple_shortcuts.md).***

# General & Appearance Settings

Tailor FlowDown’s look and editor behavior to fit your workspace. Use the settings below to keep the UI consistent across devices and reduce mistakes when sending messages.

## Appearance & Theme

- Switch among **Light / Dark / System** themes and adjust font size for markdown and chat content.
- Keep system font sizing in mind on iOS/iPadOS/macOS—accessibility settings will cascade.

## Branding Name

- Change the top-level display name (e.g., company or team name). Leave empty to keep “FlowDown.”
- Good for shared devices or kiosk-like setups where branding matters.

## Editor & Sending Preferences

- **Send confirmation** prevents accidental sends (Command/Ctrl + Enter).
- **Paste as File** converts large pastes to attachments to avoid prompt bloat.
- **Compress Image** shrinks images before upload; EXIF is removed either way.

## Model Name Display

- Pick how model names appear in chips (full name vs. short vs. hidden) to declutter the composer.

# Data Backup & Reset

Centralize backup, export, and reset guidance so you can safely move or wipe data.

## Export Settings & Backups

- Use **Settings → Data → Export Settings** to save app preferences and model configurations (without conversations).
- Use **Export Workspace / Export Database** when you need full chat history and cloud model configs.

## Reset & Risk Warnings

- **Reset Editing** or other destructive actions cannot be undone. Always export first.
- For sync issues, prefer **Reset Sync State** before a full reset.

## Recommendations

- Before upgrading TestFlight or switching devices, export workspace + settings.
- Remove credentials before sharing backups.
- After resets, verify iCloud toggles and scopes before re-enabling sync.

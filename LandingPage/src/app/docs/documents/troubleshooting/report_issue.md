# Feedback & Support

We prioritize feedback submitted through the following channels. Remove keys and personal data before sharing logs or screenshots; blur sensitive details if they appear in images.

## 1. GitHub Issues (Preferred)

- Repository: [https://github.com/Lakr233/FlowDown/issues](https://github.com/Lakr233/FlowDown/issues)
- Please include:
  - The version shown at the bottom of Settings
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Expected behavior and actual result
  - Logs collected right after reproducing: **Settings → Support → View Logs → Share** (please redact sensitive information)
  - If sync is involved, describe the iCloud Sync toggle status and scope under **Settings → Data**
- Add a label (bug/request/question) if possible.

## 2. Discord Community

- Join [discord.gg/UHKMRyJcgc](https://discord.gg/UHKMRyJcgc) to talk with community members and maintainers.
- Best for configuration questions, comparing model behavior, and confirming service status.

## 3. Email Support

- Use email only when the issue cannot be shared publicly (for example, security disclosures or commercial licensing).
- Address: flowdownapp@qaq.wiki
- Provide background, sanitized logs (View Logs → Share), and when it happened.

## Before You Report

- Restart the app, disable VPN/proxy tools, and try again.
- After reproducing, immediately collect the latest logs via **Settings → Support → View Logs → Share**.
- If it is a sync issue, confirm iCloud Sync status and scope under **Settings → Data**.
- If you are on TestFlight, include the version number shown at the bottom of Settings.

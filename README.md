**About Pricing Update**

FlowDown is scheduled to become free next year. With growing community support and feature maturity, maintenance costs have decreased, allowing us to operate more efficiently. Before this transition, prices will be reduced in phases. All core chat features will remain free, with subscription fees applying only to future personalization options.

Join the public beta on [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/StpMeybv) to try new features.

To get started, FlowDown includes complimentary access to select models. For more control, you can connect to self-hosted services or OpenAI-compatible providers. Learn more in our [documentation](https://apps.qaq.wiki/docs/flowdown/).

## Special Notes

FlowDown is designed for users who want full control over their AI models and are willing to configure them manually.

Every model behaves differently based on its capabilities, deployment method, and hardware resources. You are responsible for configuring and testing each model you use. FlowDown provides the tools and interfaces—you provide the configurations.

For bulk management, FlowDown supports importing and exporting model configurations (`.fdmodel` files). You can script the generation of configuration files and import them all at once. Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/UHKMRyJcgc) to discuss setups, but remember: community advice doesn't replace your own testing.
